!if npc.ally! *%npc.name% comes to attention and salutes you*
!if npc.ally! Welcome Sir. Its a bit quiet, so I could answer any questions you may have.
!ifnot npc.ally! *%npc.name% eyes you suspiciously*
!ifnot npc.ally! Excuse me %character.formal%, what are you doing here?
Responses:
I have a bigger gun than you. -> gun
I have a message for your boss. -> boss

Block: doing
I am currently guarding this stretch. A bit boring to be honest, but its something that is needed.
Do you need me for anything Sir?
Responses:
Oh, no. I was just passing by. Continue soldier. -> leave
Actually, I was interested in how you joined up. -> join
I'm looking for your boss. -> boss

Block: look
Well, I would be wary. This is an area owned by %owner.name% and they don't take to kindly to trespassers.
I would suggest you leave immediately, before I am forced to shoot you.
Responses:
Shoot me? You have to be kidding! -> shoot
Ok, ok, I'm leaving. -> leave2

Block: gun
Maybe. Maybe not. Lets leave comparative armoury out of the picture shall we?
Look, do you want anything?
Responses:
!if npc.ally! At ease soldier. I just wish to ask what you are doing. -> doing
!ifnot npc.ally! I am just having a look around. -> look

Block: boss
Sure. %owner.name% is not currently available, and is not taking any visitors, except by appointment.
Responses:
Oh sorry. Didn't realise. -> leave2
!if npc.ally! At ease soldier. I just wish to ask what you are doing. -> doing
!ifnot npc.ally! I am just having a look around. -> look

Block: leave
%time.ofday% sir, enjoy the rest of the day.

Block: leave2
Evidently. Goodbye.

Block: shoot
Why would that be? You are trespassing, and I would be quite within my rights to shoot you. After all, I am the only security around here.
But you wouldn't want that. I'd have to sign lots of paperwork, and it would get really tiresome. I suggest you leave.
Responses:
If you wish, then I shall. -> leave2
No. I will talk with your boss. -> boss
Paperwork eh? Is that all you are afraid of? -> paper

Block: paper
Yes. Blockheads like you go down easily. It just means several days stuck in a room explaining why.
Responses:
Better leave now then, save you some work huh. -> leave2
No. I will talk with your boss. -> boss

Block: join
Ah well sir, it was because of my early years. Spent many a year on my parents land on a frontier world. Life was hard, and lessons harder.
Everyone had to learn how to use a gun from as early as possible. Creatures and raiders and other things were rife.
Responses:
Must of been hard. -> hard
Oh. Thanks for the history, I must leave. -> leave

Block: hard
Aye, hard and fulfilling. I won most of the shooting contests while I lived there, and it was natural to settle in a life that has a predominance of weapons around.
Anyway, if you don't mind sir, I must be getting back to my duties. Otherwise my boss will have my head.
Responses:
Ok then, goodbye. -> leave

Block: me
Yes, many soldiers have the same background. Ah well, life now is better, and yet harder at the same time.
Oh, look at the time. Its best I get back to my duties.
