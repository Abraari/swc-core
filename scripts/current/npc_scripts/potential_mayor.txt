!if location.city! Good Morning, Citizens of %location.city%! Today is a wonderful day. I hope you are having an excellent time.
!ifnot location.city! Morning all, hope today is just as fulfilling as yesterday.
I see you are all enjoying the Corellian Whiskey, and the fried Bantha steaks.
Anyone have any questions for me?

God, this is boring. -> leave

Oh dear, so sad to see people leaving.

Block: plan
I do indeed have a plan for %location.city%. It will be grand, with many parks to wander through with plenty of exotic flora and fauna from around the galaxy.
I intend on removing any industrial blemishes on this great city, and free healthcare for everyone!

What about your relationship with your secretary? -> secretary
Isn't that kind of ambitious? -> ambitious
*Throw a shoe at them* -> shoe

Block: run
I do indeed. I am currently on route to a city where I will start a campaign to become mayor. I can only hope that the people there see the need, and vote me in.
I feel for the people that have no such guidance at the moment, and grand plans will be afoot to make their city the greatest in the galaxy.

What about the allegations of your misconduct with certain members of your staff? -> secretary
Do you have any plans for creature rehabilitation? -> creature

Block: shoe
*The %npc.race% dodges the shoe, and is rapidly escorted away by some burly security officers*

Block: secretary
I have only one thing to say on the matter. I did not have relations with that woman. 
Unless there are any further questions, I believe I have a meeting to attend.

!ifnot location.city! Do you expect to be a Mayor of a city soon? -> run

Block: ambitious
Not at all. Due to some prudent forging of alliances with certain groups that shall remain anonymous, I have a large funding base on which to work from.
The only question you have to answer is, will you be there at the end?

%npc.name%, %npc.name% please, answer me! -> leave2
*Throw a shoe at them* -> shoe

Block: creature
Not particularly. Any wild creatures that roam around <i>my</i> city will be shot on sight. Might even award bounties for certain creatures if they prove bothersome.
Don't worry, there will likely be plenty of work for such sentients as you willing to do work for the future of the city.

Sorry no more questions please.
