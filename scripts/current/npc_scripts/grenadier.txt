I'm just cleaning my grenades. I like to keep my darlings in top condition at all times, you never know when you'll need them. Anything I can do for you, %character.formal%?

Tell me a bit about yourself. Working with explosives seems like an interesting thing to do for a living. -> story

Isn't that obvious? I'm cleaning my darlings. Now get lost before I throw Little Timmy here at you.

They're like my children, and I am their loving mother. These precious little things have kept me alive in a lot of battles.

I'd love to hear more about those battles. -> story
You're crazy, do you know that? -> leave3

Alright. Have a nice day.
*%npc.name% starts to clean his grenade again*

Block: story
I've been fascinated by explosives ever since I was a child. Such relatively small things, causing such explosions... Such destruction... So I decided to make grenades my specialty, and here I am now. One time, a Cucul tried to kill me when I was travelling through a swamp. Luckily for me, he was allergic to explosions. I owe my life to good old Sally... she gave her life to protect me from that beast...
*%npc.name% stares at you and seems sad*
Responses:
Yes, poor old Sally. Time for me to go though. -> leave
They're just grenades, you know. You need friends. Real friends. -> leave3

Block: leave2
Oh, I will. Don't worry about that.
*%npc.name% starts to clean his grenade again, no longer paying attention to you*

Block: leave3
Beat it!
