!if npc.race=Dug! !if character.race=Dug! *%npc.name% stamps its right foot on the ground twice, making a clicking sound with its mouth at the same time. A greeting of indifference.*
!if npc.race=Dug! !if character.race=Gran! *A stout Dug glares at you, it's best not to approach it.*
!if npc.race=Dug! !ifnot character.race=Dug! !ifnot character.race=Gran! What, what... what do you want, %character.race%?
!ifnot npc.race=Dug! *A confident %npc.race% presents their hand to you, waiting for you to shake it.*
Responses:
!if npc.race=Dug! !if character.race=Dug! *Repeat %npc.name%'s actions.* -> dancedance
!if npc.race=Dug! !ifnot character.race=Dug! Why the long face? -> joke
!ifnot npc.race=Dug! *Shake* -> shake
*Shrug and walk away* -> leave

Block: dancedance
Yes, yes... I've heard about you. 
*%npc.name% produces his hand, waiting for you to shake it* 
It is a pleasure and...gratifying. Hearing about other Dugs off of Malastare. Another racer, correct?
Responses:
!if npc.ally! *Shake* -> shake
I don't want to get into that. What about you? You seem busy. -> purpose
I don't have time for this. -> leave

Block: joke
!if character.race=Gran! *The seemingly angry creature refuses to so much as acknowledge your presense, perhaps you'll have better luck elsewhere.*
!ifnot character.race=Gran! Yeah, yeah. Heard them all %character.race%. What do you want?
Responses:
%character.race%? Not the warmest of welcomes... -> xenophobe
Whatever. -> leave2

Block: xenophobe
No, no, don't try to lecture me. You know nothing of this. Ever been to Malastare? Didn't think so. No... not going to explain it now. What do you want?
Responses:
Yeah, you're right... I should probably go. -> leave
Uh huh. *Leave* -> leave2

Block: shake
Don't mind me, just checking for weapons... Haha! I kid, I kid. Anyway, what is it that you want?
Responses:
Well, you didn't look very hard, did you...? -> weapon
Yes, very witty... What is it that you're doing here? -> purpose
Yeah, uh. I'm going... over... -> leave

Block: weapon
%owner.name%'s got my back... or at least I like to think so.
Responses:
You don't sound terribly confident about that... -> signedup
Yeah... I think I'll do without angering %owner.name%. -> leave
Well, I have things to do. -> leave

Block: purpose
*Shrugs, taking a seat with no regard as to whether you wished to either*
Bah, you'd have to go ask %owner.name%. Whatever that %owner.entityType% has me do, it sure ain't what I signed up for.
Responses:
Not what you signed up for? -> signedup
Where can I find %owner.name%. -> owner
Well, you sound like you're busy. Bye. -> leave

Block: signedup
*%npc.name% lets out a deep sigh*
Yeah, I should've seen it coming. "Know your way around a speeder and like to live your life on the edge?" they said, "Come and join %owner.name% and experience every day as though it were your last!" they said... 
I spend half my time waiting for them to load up only to find some freelance freighter pilot has "taken care of it".
!if npc.race=Dug! It's just not the same as back on Malastare...
!ifnot npc.race=Dug! Nothing like the Galactic Circuit...
Responses:
Well, good luck. -> leave

Block: raced
Yeah. Good pay, but there just aren't enough races to make a stable living out of it. Not unless you go pro.

Block: owner
Beats me.

Block: leave
See ya.

Block: leave2
*The Dug shakes his head when you walk away, lightly muttering under its breath*
Chesko, sleemo.
