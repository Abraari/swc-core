Hello there. Got any scrap on ya?
Responses:
Scrap? -> scrap
Sorry, I need everything. -> need
Sure, I think I have something around here. -> have

Block: scrap
Yeah. Scrap, refuse, garbage. Stuff you feel has no more use. 
I take what no-one else wants, and turns it into much, much more valuable material.
Responses:
Cool. What do you take? -> take
Pah, sounds boring. -> boring
Hmm, may have something. -> have
Nope, nothing here. -> need

Block: need
Thats a shame. Could use a good piece of scrap. Not had much these last few weeks.
Well, if you see a rusting metal carcass somewhere, don't hesitate to give me a shout.
Responses:
Sure thing. -> leave
Actually, may have something on me. -> have

Block: have
Really? That would make my day. Let me have a look.
*The %npc.race% looks through what you offer*
Gah, that stuff is useless to even me! There is nothing worthwhile in here at all.
Responses:
What would you take then? -> take
Really? Thats a shame. -> leave

Block: take
Pretty much anything. So long as its large and near total destruction, I can deal with it.
Stations I can rip up in a few days or so. Ships are a nice challenge and I get a lot out of them after stripping them down.
Responses:
Oh. I don't have any of those. -> leave

Block: boring
Well, not a job for many I suppose. I like the challenge of stripping something of all its valuables, and then melting down the remaining shell.
Actually quite theraputic after a stressful day with the wife, if you get my meaning.
Responses:
Yeah, sometimes I wish I could do that. -> help
Still doesn't sound that great. Sorry. -> leave
Note quite sure I have anything for you though. -> need

Block: leave
Going so soon? Make sure you have some scrap when you come back!

Block: help
Well, maybe you could. I know of several groups that I work for that arrange such duties.
Take a look around, I could possibly give you a reference if you want.
Responses:
That would be great. -> leave
