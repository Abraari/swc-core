Not working so well is it - you're watching me. Fine. I'm looking into other people's accounts, and skimming out the fractional credits that they don't know about.
They all add up, you see. Soon, I can buy myself a ship, and some flying lessons.

Oh ok. Thats pretty cool. I'll leave you to it. -> leave
Can you show me how to do it? -> show

Block: show
I'm afraid not. Sorry, but it takes a certain amount of competence to work it.
