Before we make the journey to the fountain itself, I must ask, in accordance with the Council of Elders decree, that you check all technological devices with the guards here. They will be returned to you upon the conclusion of the tour.
*Two large Klatooinians open a cargo container to hold your items. After turning them in, you follow %npc.name% to the fountain site*
The Fountain of Ancients began forming many thousands of years ago. If you look closely at the base of the structure you can see the fissure where wintrium seeps to the surface and comes in contact with the dry desert air of Klatooine. As the winds cool the wintrium it adds to the frozen plume making the Fountain a slowly evolving, almost living scuplture.
*%npc.name% pauses for a moment and looks at you as if to invite questions*
Responses:
What is wintrium? I have never heard of it before. -> wintrium
So, the fountain is ever changing? -> changing
Please continue. -> part2

Block: part2
when the early Klatoonians discovered the Fountain, they revered it as a gift from the Ancients symbolizing that age brings strength and the necessity for tenacity and patience. Since its discovery, the Fountain has held a central place in all Klatooinian religion and politics. It is considered the most holy of all holy sites for my people.
*Once again the guide pauses, waiting for questions*
Responses:
When was the fountain discovered? -> when
Who are the Ancients? -> ancients
Please continue. -> part3

Block: part3
That concludes the tour of The Fountain of the Ancients. Please free to spend as much time as you wish admiring this treasure of the galaxy. Also feel free to ask any other questions that you might have.

Block: wintrium
Wintrium is one of the rarest substances in the galaxy. It is only found here on Klatooine, under the surface of the planet. In its cooled form, as seen here at the Fountain, it is virtually indestrucible. It is also thought to be the reason why Klatooine is the only place where the delicious pak'pah fruit grows.
Responses:
Pak'pah fruit? I have never heard of that. -> pakpah
Indestructible? Someone could make a fortune using it to make armor or starship hulls. -> fortune
Ah, okay. You said the fountain is 'almost living' what do you mean? -> changing
Thank you, please continue with the tour. -> part2

Block: pakpah
Pak'pah is a delicious fruit that is only known to grow here on Klatooine. It is dark purple in color and tastes better than anything you have ever eaten. Word of caution though, you will need to peel the skin from the pak'pah before you attempt to eat it. I highly recommend that you try some during you stay here on Klatooine.
Responses:
Interesting. I will try to remember to track some down before I leave. Please continue with the tour. -> part2

Block: changing
Yes, the Fountian of the Ancients is a current, although extremely slow, state of flux. As more wintrium seeps to the surface and cools it adds to the structure. Given enough time between visits, you would see these changes. Although I fear there are few races with lifespans long enough to be able to notice the changes.
Responses:
I see, thank you. Please continue. -> part2
You said the fountain is made of wintrium, what is that? -> wintriumb

Block: when
Although the exact date of the discovery has been lost to the ages, it is known to have happened over 10,000 years ago.
Responses:
Wow, that is old. Is that why it is called the Fountian of the Ancients? -> ancients
Thank you, please continue. -> part3

Block: ancients
!if character.race=Hutt! Please excuse my assumption, Most honorable Master Hutt, but I thought all Hutts knew of the legend claiming that they are thought by many to be the Ancients.
!ifnot character.race=Hutt! The Ancients are the deities of the Klatooinian religion. We believe that strength is born of age, so those who are the oldest are therefore the strongest. No one would be stronger than one who is Ancient.
Responses:
!if character.race=Hutt! You consider my race to be the gods of your people? -> old
!ifnot character.race=Hutt! So the Ancients are just really old Klatooinians? -> old
When was the fountain discovered? -> whenb

Although cooled wintrium is indestrucable to the point of not being able to be cut or shaped, the Council of Elders would never allow the mining of liquid wintrium. The point is moot.
*The guide is visibly sickened by the thought of using wintrium for any commerical purpose*
Responses:
Just saying, it could be a major money maker and change the way wars are fought. But please continue the tour. -> part2
I apologize if I offended you, I let my entrepreneurial nature control my mouth. Please continue the tour. -> part2

Block: old
There are many Klatooinians who believe that the Hutts are in fact the Ancients, or atleast as close to knowing them as we can get. Because of the generous opportunities afforded to us by the most honorable Hutts, they are held in very high regard even by the ones who do not believe them to be deities.
Responses:
Fascinating, I had no idea that was the case. Please continue with the tour. -> part3
