!if npc.ally! *%npc.name% comes to attention and salutes you*
!if npc.ally! Greetings %character.formal%! I'm glad to see you. Have you come to check on me? Rarely do we get visitors here in the Engineering Bay.
!ifnot npc.ally! Hello %character.formal%, how can I help?
Responses:
!if npc.ally! At ease, what can you tell me about the %container.name%? -> about
!if npc.ally! At ease Engineer, how are you handling here? -> handle
!ifnot npc.ally! Are you in charge of this place? -> place

Block: about
Well I won't bore you with details %character.formal%, I can say the ship is in a top shape, the Engines are running good and all systems are vital. You might want to check that !random [depressurised zone we closed last week, hull breach in the lower deck, computers failure in Navigation's]!, if we engage in battle it may cause some major damage.
Responses:
I will leave this situation in your capable hands. -> situation
I don't think we will engage in combat any time soon, let's talk about you instead. -> join
Why wasn't I informed about these problems? I will attend to this immediately. -> problem

Block: handle
Everything seems to be fine %character.formal%, me and my crew were just discussing the Engines.
Responses:
Couldn't care less, mind telling me what's going on in my ship? -> about
Carry on. -> leave

Block: engine
You see %character.formal%, me and the crew were thinking how can we improve our Engines quality. Right now we are running on the producer's designs, and personally I think we can do better.
Responses:
I don't think we can afford such upgrades currently. -> bad

Block: bad
That's too bad, maybe in the future. Anything else %character.formal%?
Responses:
Tell me about yourself. -> join
No, carry on. -> leave

Block: great
That's great news %character.formal%! It will allow us to increase our Engine capacity as well as speed and maneuverability. It will take some time however, such changes will have to be made gradually until we can enhance our systems. For now, how else can I help you %character.formal%?

That will be all, carry on. -> leave2

Block: place
Yes, I am %npc.infofield% %npc.name% and I'm running this place. I don't see any suspicious activity in the ship, have you come to report something?
Responses:
Actually I was wondering where the Crew Quarters in this ship are. -> direction
I heard the Captain was calling all officers to the main deck, maybe you should check it out? -> game

Block: problem
Sorry %character.formal%, I thought you were aware of the situation.
Responses:
Aren't you supposed to be in charge of this? -> situation

Block: situation
I will take care of it right now %character.formal%! Crew, assemble!
Responses:
Excellent work %npc.name%, I will check on your progress later. -> leave2
That's alright, you can take care of it later. Let's talk a little about yourself instead. -> join

Block: direction
You go back, turn right, continue down the hallway and you should see a sign that says "Crew Quarters".
Responses:
Thank you. -> leave

Block: leave
Goodbye %character.formal%.

Block: leave2
Thank you again for going down here %character.formal%, goodbye!
*%npc.name% smiles and heads to the nearby panel to continue the work*

Block: game
I didn't hear anything in the PA system, please don't play games with me %character.formal%. I should get back to work, do you need anything else?

Alright then, goodbye. -> leave

About me %character.formal%? Well I am just an Engineer, nothing special about me. I lived most of my life in space, handling Starships is all I know. I graduated from the Engineering Academy with my !seed [brother, sister]! and we both went to work in a Shipyard in the !seed [Corellian, Trax, Coruscant]! Sector. We haven't spoken in a while, maybe I'll do so next time we dock in a port. You see I just love Starships, this is why I find great pleasure taking care of them so much. Your fine ship is in good hands %character.formal%. Oh well... That's enough about me, hope I haven't wasted your time %character.formal%.
Responses:
You didn't waste my time, I'm happy to get to know my crew. -> good

Block: good
Thank you %character.formal%, I hope you'll come see me again sometimes.
Responses:
That would be a pleasure. -> leave2
Don't count on it. -> leave

Block: yes
Of course %character.formal%, sorry.
Responses:
Ok then, goodbye. -> leave
