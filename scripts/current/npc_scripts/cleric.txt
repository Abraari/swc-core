What? What ridiculous thing is that? Panic indeed. Pah. Time was I would be treated with respect. Look what I get nowadays.

Aye. I can do a cleansing for you if you wish. Special, one time offer. I'll even let you use my equipment.

No thanks, I'm off. -> leave
Sure, why not. What do you need me to do? -> need

Block: pious
Blasphemy! Pagan, infidel, heretic! I shall wipe you from existance, and none shall know of your existance, you %character.race%.

This I <i>have</i> to see. -> see
Catch me if you can! -> leave

Block: leave
Run away. The deity's wrath shall follow you to kingdom come!

Block: religion
Ah, a bit of this, a bit of that. Many times I have left a religion just as it reaches the peak of existance and then falls into depravity. I have a knack for sensing this.
At the moment I am doing some freelancing work.
Responses:
Freelancing religion? -> free
Ah. Then what is this Word you are spreading? -> word

Block: free
Yes. Got something against that? Makes me a good income, all these people from different religions paying me. Ah, here come some now, so I'd better be off.

Block: see
*The %npc.race% feebly swings his fist at you, misses, and twirls around before falling in a heap on the floor*
Responses:
I'll leave you to wallow in piousness then huh? -> pious

Block: need
Well I will need your clothes. Any credit slips you have on you. And any ships or vehicles or anything like that really.
I will be rebirthing you, and you will not need any of that heretical stuff afterwards.
Responses:
You have got to be joking! I'm outta here. -> leave
I'm sorry, my stuff is my stuff. -> leave

Block: word
The Good Word is what every sentient should follow. Doesn't matter which religion you are from, they all have the same meaning. Each shows themselves as different, and yet they are all alike.
Or, if you prefer, the Word is 'peace'. Of course, everyone will ignore that word anyway, but there it is.
Responses:
Thats it? Seems simple. -> simple
You're a charlatan. I will have no more of oyu. -> leave

Block: simple
Indeed. Much that is important is simple, but many do not see that. Anyway, go spread the word, and may your travels be fruitful.
!if character.race=Gungan! And though you may be ridiculed now, in time your race will be honoured above all else, and then you will be vindicated.
Responses:
Thank you. Good bye. -> leave
!if character.race=Gungan! You believe so? Meesa going to be rich! -> leave
