Hi there, how can I help you?

I'm actually looking for a way off this planet. -> trans
Can you point me to the nearest bar? -> bar
You can't. Nobody can. -> leave

Oh ok then, Goodbye.

Block: bar
A bar? Oh a tavern. Sorry, I'm not well acquainted with any of those establishments.
Best thing to do would be to look around the city yourself, see if you can spot one.
Responses:
Oh thanks. -> leave
Can you help me with anything then? -> help

Block: help
Sure. I can tell you how to get off this godforsaken rock, but not much else I'm afraid.
Responses:
Oh. Thanks anyway then. -> leave

Ah. Sure thing. Well there are several methods for it, though some are better than others for different reasons.
There is the Transport Network, Classifieds, and Factions. Which would you like to know about?
Responses:
Transport Network. -> net
Factions. -> faction

Have a look there. The Transportation section has a list of people that are offering transport services. 
You can also make a post asking for a pickup. However, this area is not that great compared with the others.

There are many factions out there, and there is a chance you are already with one. Generally they can arrange a pickup for you either using their own guys, or hired help.
However, there is a ground of factions, the Transport factions, that generally deal with this sort of thing. If you contact them, they should be able to tell you costs and times.

The Transport Network. A fine undertaking, by any standard. If you head to the nearest starport, you can see if it can arrange transport for you. 
There is usually one starport on each races homeworld that will allow you to travel to any of the other starports on homeworlds. It can also take you to a startport owned by your faction.
There are a few other restrictions and such about this form of travel. Best to look at this information flyer.

Not much. If none of those help you, best to ask around see if anyone can help. There are the odd one or two kindly souls who help out.
Other than that, not much more I can tell you.

Ok, thanks. -> leave
Can you repeat that please? -> trans
