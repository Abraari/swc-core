Quite nicely, %character.formal%. My skills increase with every day of this training.
Responses:
Excellent, excellent. We may have to take you into the field one of these days for some real combat experience. -> fieldwork

Block: training2
Sorry %character.formal%, but I don't think you have the clearance to be asking those kinds of question.
Responses:
Right then, I'll be leaving. -> leaving

Block: fieldwork
Why, I'd love some field experience, %character.formal%. Let me know when some becomes available.

Of course. Be ready for my call. In the meantime however, I shall take my leave. -> leaving

Sure, I guess. What is it you would like to know?

I was wondering who has such a skilled fighter within their forces. -> owner
How does one get as skilled as yourself? -> tipsandtricks
Whats your biggest kill? -> boasting

Block: owner
Why, just %owner.name%. A really fair employer, couldn't be happier. Now that was your one question, so scoot off quickly before the sarge notices you.

Block: tipsandtricks
Well, plenty of training with your weapon of choice, and then get some real combat experience using it. That's your only question, so buzz off quickly before we both get in trouble.

Block: boasting
Well, if you really want to know, I once killed a full grown Rancor with this very knife. Just about killed me, but I still bested the blasted thing. Now off with you, before someone sees!
