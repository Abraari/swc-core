Anything I can help you with?
Responses:
Why yes good sir, I am looking to acquire certain assets. -> acquire
Buddy! <b>Pal!</b> You, sir, will feel the sting of my blaster! -> fight

Block: acquire
Are you indeed? Are you quite sure? Some of my wares are, shall we say, quite rare. Rare and illegal. Mostly illegal. Generally.
Do you care to peruse my stock. I am quite certain there are no law enforcement officers of any real consequence around here.
Responses:
I'm always looking for such things -> look
Sure, I like that sound of tha ... SLAVES! -> indignation
Indeed, I live on the wild side. -> slave
Hmm, after some thought, no. Sorry. -> leave

Block: fight
Really? I find you very much mistaken my very young vigilante.
Guards, remove this %character.race% from my sight. I tire of their presence.

Block: look
Really? I may be of some assistance in that regard. I know the lands and people around here quite well. 
Tell you what, why don't you step into my tent here, I have some maps and such in there.
Responses:
Excellent, I've been looking for someone to help me for hours. -> tent
Hmm, you know what, I think I may be better off on my own. -> leave

Block: indignation
Yeah, of course. What did you think I was selling over here? Cupcakes? Deathsticks? Ears?
Do you mean that you are not looking for some slaves?
Responses:
There does seem to be some miscomunication here. Goodbye. -> leave
Umm, maybe then. Show me what you have. -> slave

Block: leave
Really? Oh well, what fun times we could have had together. Enjoy yourself.

Block: tent
Many wondrous thanks. Just step this way, and we'll have you set up in just a jiffy.
Responses:
Sounds good -> inside
Actually, maybe not. -> leave

Block: inside
Ah there we go. Just sit down there a second, this won't take a minute.

Wakey, wakey sunshine. You're all mine now, don't struggle.
Responses:
Wha, whats going on? -> capture

Block: capture
You are now a slave of mine. I hope you didn't have many plans for the future.
Haha, just a joke of mine. Here, lets free you.
Responses:
You know what, let me see your other slaves. -> slave

Block: slave
Excellent, most glorious of days! I have recently just had in some new stock that you may be interested in.
I have a fine selection of sentients from all over the galaxy. Which stock are you interested in?
Responses:
Well, I'm actually after some form of personal slave. -> personal
I have need for some heavy set guys. -> heavy

Block: personal
Sure thing, over here are my slaves...
Umm, maybe over there...
I'm sorry, seems I've run out of those slaves.
Responses:
Oh, thats disappointing. Any others? -> slave
Shame. Oh well, see you around. -> leave

Block: heavy
Excellent, you see these beast of creatures over here? Hes stronger than a Krayt Dragon, and twice as stupid. Of course he costs the same a small planet.
This one here, small but wiry, he can level a forest in just a few hours. Cost is the same as a large battleship.
I have a few others, but by the look of you you cannot afford any of that.
Responses:
Ah. Well then. I'll just be off then huh? -> leave
Hmm, a bit pricey. Anything else? -> slave
