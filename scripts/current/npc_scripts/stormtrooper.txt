!if npc.ally! It's nice to see you again %character.formal%
!ifnot npc.ally! *%npc.name% stands infront of you menacingly*
!ifnot npc.ally! %character.formal%, you're not on my list and i have never seen you before.. what's that you want from here?
Responses:
Hey! *%npc.name% what's up? -> talk
Good, nice to see you again too *%npc.name%, by the way, nice armor. -> end
I have important information I must deliver to %owner.name%, and I must go in to do it. -> Information
*throw rock and run* -> fleave
I see you're tired, need some help? -> help
I just came here to talk.. -> talk

Block: talk
*npc.name stares at %character.formal%*
It's been a long time I didn't talk to anyone, I guess being a stormtrooper made me a little more anti-social...
*%npc.name% sighs*
Well, if you want to talk, let's talk. What do you want to talk about?
Responses:
Let's talk about your life -> interested
Nothing, I was just teasing you, why in the world would I want to talk with a stormtrooper? -> fleave

Block: end
Thank you %character.formal%. It was nice to talk with you, but I have to leave now, %owner.name% is calling me!

Block: end2
Haha! really, I was, but not anymore, leave or %owner.name% will surely yell at me for talking to you while on duty.

Block: Information
I can't let you in, if you want to deliver that information, tell %owner.name% to come here and tell me you can come in, or tell him to put you on the entrance list.
Responses:
Ok, I will -> leave
If you don't let me in I'll enter either way -> leave2
Get out of the way or I kill you! -> fleave

Block: leave
Goodbye %character.formal%.

Block: leave2
*%npc.name% gets angry%*
You have two options, you either leave now and come back when the boss allows you to go in, or I will take you out myself and not by the better means, you understand what this means!? 
I highly suggest you to leave before I get annoyed, if you appreciate your own life.
*%npc.name% points his gun towards %character.formal%'s head*
Responses:
Ok, I will leave, calm down... -> leave
If you want me to leave, it will have to be OVER MY DEAD CORPSE -> fleave

Block: fleave
So that's what you want huh?
*%npc.name%* shoots his gun towards %character.formal% missing repeatedly*

Block: help
Well yes... I've been here for months and I can't stand this anymore, there's never anything to shoot and there's always something boring to do... 
*%npc.name% sighs*
But hey, that's the tough job of a stormtrooper.
Responses:
That must be a tough life, was the training as tough as your current job? -> training
Tell me more about your job as a stormtrooper -> confidential
Stop whining and get over it dude -> fleave

Block: training
The training? nah.. it was not as boring as this job, it was actually pretty awesome, we used to do every kind of things you know, parachuting from THETA launchers, practicing amphibian atacks, learning about proton and ion cannon systems, learning to shoot accurately with our different kinds of blasters.. oh yes, the good life.. the good life... I was expecting this to be as good as the training, to get some action you know, but hey, not everything on this life is fair or fun!
Responses:
Oh well, I hope that you get some action soon %npc.name%. I have to leave now, many things to do, not much time to do it, see you soon! -> leave
That's so cool! tell me more! -> confidential

Block: confidential
Sorry %character.formal%, that's top secret confidential information that only stormtroopers and associates have access to.
Perhaps you should enlist for one, I think you would become a great stormtrooper if you did!
Responses:
Perhaps, I'll think on that for the future, but for now, I have things to do, goodbye %npc.name%! -> leave
... No, stormtroopers stink -> fleave

Block: interested
Oh, so you're interested on my life hum?
My life is so...! not interesting, I just stay here all day doing nothing at all, waiting for %owner.name% to give me a boring task to do, you know, that's basically what I do every day of my life.
Believe me, you would never want to have a life like mine..
Responses:
Thanks for the tip, goodbye! -> leave
No, I don't want to have a life as sucky as yours, you and your life both fail -> fleave
