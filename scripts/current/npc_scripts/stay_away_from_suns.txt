*The sentient grabs you on the shoulder, leaning in close to your face*
Have ye heard? Have ye seen? Are ye marked?
Responses:
Excuse me? -> huh
Urgh, I, umm, have to be somewhere else. -> leave
This is a gun, and I know how to use it. -> gun

Block: huh
Are ye deaf as well as blind siree? Have ye seen the sun recently?
'tis a grand new sport the rich and bored have taken to trying.
Responses:
I'm sorry, the sun? Sport? Care to elaborate? -> sun
Oh that. Thats old news. Already tried it a few times. -> credulation
You know what? I've had it with crazy people. -> leave

Block: leave
Well, best be off then, hadn't ye? Can't leave that sun alone. It may become lonely!
Hahaha...hrmph... cough cough.

Block: gun
Oh, it be like that I see? I be an old man, m'lord.
*He moves like lightning and relieves you of your gun*
Ohh, 'tis mighty fine indeed, yes siree.
Responses:
Umm, gun please. Now. -> return
Pah, beggars. -> leave

Block: return
*They return the gun just as swiftly, making you almost think that they hadn't taken it in the first place*
What gun, m'lord? The one in your belt there? Ye must think me one o' the rich and bored with them kinds of reflexes.
Responses:
Oh, umm, yeah. About that sun sport. -> sun
Pah, I know you took it, old man. Goodbye. -> leave

Block: sun
Aye, 'tis a grand sport, practiced all over the galaxy. Many a young fool 'as taken it into 'is head that he can fly closer to the nearest sun than none 'as before.
Usually 'tis true, but they generally would prefer to be alive on the other side. Ye see, none comes back from these trips.
Responses:
People fly <i>into</i> a sun? Why? -> why
So not much of a repeat sport then huh? -> jest

Block: why
Why not? They are bored. Of course, they are also generally too stupid to realize that they won't survive a trip near the sun of their choice, but that's natural selection for you.
Of course, if they are poor, bored people they usually steal other peoples ships. They get quite angry when someone destroys their ship in such a foolhardy quest.
Responses:
So, I gather that there aren't too many people that perform it a second time huh? -> jest
Well, I quite like the sound of that. I may try it. -> leave2

Block: leave2
Oh, ye're one of them. I thought ye were of a better class. Nonetheless, good luck with ye venture.

Block: jest
Oh, I see. A joke, no? Very witty. I haven't heard that one since, ooh, ten minutes ago.
'tis no joking matter, me friend. Many a good person 'as felt the sway of the nearest ball of plasma and gas and left for other places.
Responses:
Oh. I'm sorry. -> leave

Block: credulation
*The sentient in front of you splutters incoherently for a bit*
Ye, ye what!? Are ye sure that's what happened? Was't not merely a light show ye got taken to, ye simpleton?
Responses:
Aye that may of been it. -> leave
Why, what is it really? -> sun
No, idiot. I have powers beyond mere mortal ken. -> silly

Block: silly
Oh. Right. Umm, I'll just pop around here a sec. Got a, umm, drink to get. Yes, that's it, a drink. 
I'll be back in, oh, say a couple of weeks.
