You lookin' for a fight? You can insult me, you can insult my friends, you can insult my girlfriend, you can even insult my family, but NO ONE ever, and I mean EVER insults my speeder bike! got that straight, punk?
Responses:
You're just a joker, you're nothing more than an arrogant guy pretending to be a professional speeder pilot! -> reasons
I'm always in for a fight! Come here so I can knock you on the floor! -> rage2

Block: rage2
You want a fight? then you'll have a fight!
Don't think you'll fight me, noooo.. it's not me who you insulted! my speeder is the one that wants revenge!
*%npc.name% drives his speeder, sending all the pipe's dust directly to your face*

Block: talk
*%npc.name% holds tight to his speeder*
Allright boy, what do you want to talk about? Hurry up, I have to run in a few minutes.
Responses:
How's your life as a speeder? I mean, what drove you to choose speeder piloting as your career? -> passion
Oh, then I don't want to take any more time away from you, we'll talk later I guess -> leave
I just came here to give you a good pay to become my personal speeder pilot... but seeing that the 'run' is more important than me, I'll just have to go look for another one, peace out man! -> leave2

Block: passion
*%npc.owner% starts thinking with a smile on his face for a second*
When I was a kid, I had this passion for everything that could be droven... since the first time my dad brought me that real size speeder bike for kids.. everything started there.. yeah..
I was 8 years old, I lived under a poor family my entire life.. oh, it reminds me I didn't stop peeing my pants untill I was 8, but that's a whole different story.. hum.
Oh well anyways, he bought me that real size speeder for my birthday, since he didn't buy anything for me in any birthday before that one, he really wanted to make a special gift to me.. soon, my only toy became my speeder bike, it even drove me to save some money for the future. 
Some years after that, my passion for biking made me buy a better speeder bike, not so fast, not so slow.. but enough as to start my career.. of course I had to start as a pizza delivery guy but hey, look where I'm now, talking to a total stranger in the middle of nowhere about my not so interesting past life. 
Actually, that's pretty fail, not very cool I would say.
Responses:
I'm sorry about your past experience, and I'm glad you're making enough money to live with your speeder piloting career -> leave3
