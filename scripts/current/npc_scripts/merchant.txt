Lucky for you I am just the %npc.race% to relieve of you that burden.

By trading those credits you have for some of the wonderful items I have, of course.

I worked hard for these credits, you would have to have something fantastic for me to just give them to you. -> give
Well I did just make some extra cash betting a speeder race. -> items
Sorry, not interested. Thanks anyway. -> leave

*The merchant chuckles slightly*
You have that special "look" about you. The looks of someone who knows what they need. I happen to be a someone that knows how to get you what you need.
Responses:
Okay, okay if it will shut you up, let me have a look at whatcha got. -> black2
Actually you are right about me, I know what I need. And I need to leave. -> leave

What kinda scam are you trying to run here, sleemo? -> scam
Just as I thought, go bother someone else. -> leave

You misundertand, I also worked hard building a business here. Think of it as a bartering of our skills, we can both benefit from each other's hard work.
Responses:
Since you put it that way, let me see what you have. -> items
You slimey slick talking %npc.race%, just how many credits have you weasled out of people today? Take your 'hard work' and offer it to someone else. -> leave

Block: items
*The merchant's eyes light up*
I knew that would wo...er...*cough*...uhm... Take a look are my offerings, let me know what catches your eye.
*You can tell within seconds that most of what is sold here is just junk. Many of the items look as if they haven't worked in years*
Responses:
I really don't see anything that I can't live without today. Maybe next time. -> offer
This stuff is garbage. I would rather go back and bet on that race again, this time wagering on the loser. -> leave

Block: look
Smart,!if character.gender=Male! handsome,!if character.gender=Female! beautiful, and funny. You are truly a triple threat aren't you.
Responses:
Flattery is going to get you nowhere. Now about these 'items'...is this just a scam? -> scam

Block: scam
No, no. This a not a scam. I am simply a means to which you can get those hard to find items through. I work as a middleman for %owner.name%. If you contact my employer, you will have access to more things than you have ever imagined.
Responses:
So you do all the work, your boss makes all the credits. Smart. Thanks for the connection, I'll look them up sometime. -> thanks
You sure do take a long time and use a lot of words to say very little of value. Good luck with that. -> leave

Block: offer
Hold on, don't leave. I actually work for %owner.name%. The boss keeps most of the good stuff to sell personally.
Responses:
But judging by what you have here, "the good stuff" is probably just garbage that has been cleaned. -> leave
Next time I am in a shopping mood, I'll try to remember that name. Thanks. -> thanks

Block: thanks
Remember mention my name--%npc.name%, if the boss is in a good mood, you might get a discount.
