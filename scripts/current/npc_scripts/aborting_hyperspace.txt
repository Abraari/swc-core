Dangers await you, young %character.race%. Beware of all around you.
Responses:
Yeah, yeah, whatever. -> ever
Are you part of that danger? -> danger

Block: ever
Well, your doom then. No skin off me. Enjoy the last few moments of your living future.

Block: question
Indeed there are. The main one however is hyperspace. Suns too, but not so much.
Responses:
Suns? -> sun
Hyperspace? Is there something I should know? -> pilot

Block: danger
Maybe, maybe not. You never know, and that is the truth. For as I speak, I may have nefarious friends who are now quietly sneaking up on you!
*%npc.name% starts laughing as you look behind you*
Or maybe not, ha ha ha.
Responses:
Not funny. I am not dealing with you further. -> leave
Ok then, any <i>real</i> dangers around then? -> question

Block: pilot
Of course you must. Throughout your travels you will be traveling in hyperspace. And occasionally you may have need to abort that travel.
But be aware! Some danger exists when you attempt this. If you happen to be anywhere near a system with planets, there is a very real danger of exiting hyperspace inside one of them.
Responses:
Inside? -> inside
Pah, the chances of that are slim to none. -> slim

Block: sun
Yeah, they are dangerous. But not what I am alluding to, I'm afraid. More dangerous than that.
Responses:
What then? Should I know? -> pilot
Meh, whatever. -> ever

Block: leave
Ok, do what you want. I'll stay here.

Block: inside
Aye, inside. Not very pretty, as you can imagine. Anyway, keep that in mind while you're whizzing around in nothingness up there. 
Me, my feet will stay on the ground as much as possible.
Responses:
Thanks. -> leave

Block: slim
Slim is still possible though. But up to you though.
