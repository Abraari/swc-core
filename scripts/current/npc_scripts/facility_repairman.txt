Glad you asked, I love talking about my job.
As you can see, I'm doing some finishing work on this room here, after we had a bit of minor damage recently. Nothing to be concerned about. 
Right now, I'm sealing up the last cracks in this load-bearing wall, then I'll run atmo tests to make sure we're sealed tightly. Then it's painting, a few more tests, and it'll be just like new.

I'm fully qualified to conduct every step of a facility repair job, from electrical to structural to life support, to detailed finish work. My favorite job? Anything involving heavy construction. I love swinging hammers, laser-cutting, and heavy-lifting.

So you're not into precision work as much? More of the big-picture sorts of repairs? -> heavywork

Block: history
I've always been skilled with tools. Back on my homeworld, I worked odd jobs to put myself through a building trades program, then I apprenticed on a series of construction projects around the galaxy. I actually did some of the electrical work when they were building Centrepoint Station. 
After that, I wound up here, and I'm happy with my current employer.

Exactly. I'm good at fussy little jobs, like this one. But give me, say, a corridor where some fool accidentally set off a thermal detonator, and tell me to fix the damage, and I'm happy as a Gungan in the water.

OK, but I will not divulge any sensitive information, and I think I'll keep my tools handy, thank you very much. What do you require?

What do I look like, a tour guide? If you can't figure out where you are, then I'm amazed you've gotten this far in the galaxy.
Do you require anything else?
