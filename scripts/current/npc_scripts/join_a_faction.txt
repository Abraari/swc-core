Hi there. What's up?
Responses:
Not much, having a look around. -> look
Huh? Leave me alone! -> leave
I'm looking for a good time. You free? -> time

Block: look
Really? That's good. Not much to look at though around here.
Hey, you may want to have a look at joining a faction; they usually will find something for you to look at.
Responses:
A faction huh? Care to explain a bit more? -> faction
You know what, that's some pseudo-political talk right there. -> leave
Thanks, but I've already found one. -> already

Block: leave
You feel like that, hmm? Fine, see you around. Don't need that kind of attitude.

Block: time
Maybe. Tell you what though, better times are had if you find yourself a faction.
They can help you out with all sorts of things.
Responses:
Really? Well that sounds interesting, do you know anything more? -> faction
I was actually after something a bit more personal than that. -> leave
To be honest I've already found myself one. -> already

Block: faction
Well, factions are complicated beasts. They are groups of sentients that work together for a common goal. There are many different types and they incorporate many varied areas of life.
For instance a Droid Production faction will be involved in the construction of various different droids, while a Religious faction will lean more towards spreading their religion and bringing in tithes from their churches and chapels.
There is a public listing of factions available that you can peruse at your leisure. Here, I have a copy you can borrow.
*The sentient in front of you passes over a small holodisc with the listing visible under the title: <a href="http://www.swcombine.com/community/factions.php">Galactic Faction Registry</a>*
Responses:
Meh, sounds a bit boring to tell you the truth. -> leave

Block: already
Thats excellent. I hope you are enjoying yourself there.
Just remember that there are plenty more factions out there, so don't think you are stuck there. Though I do warn you that factions don't take too kindly to sentients that hop in and out of them like yo-yos.
Responses:
Thanks for that, I'll keep it in mind. See ya. -> leave2
Spoil sport, that's my entire plan, muhahaha! -> leave

Sure thing. Have fun, whatever you choose.
