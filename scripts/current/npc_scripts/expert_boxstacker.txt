OK, but I will not divulge any sensitive information, and that alarm is within reach. What do you require?

I'm free at the moment %character.formal%, it's no bother.

I'm just struck by something: You don't see many %npc.race% boxstackers. -> backstory
Tell me about our current location. -> location
Well, I've got more pressing business. Please carry on. -> end

Block: stacker2
There's much more to being an expert boxstacker than merely stacking boxes. We also have to lift boxes, decide where to put them, and of course do all the little jobs required to keep this place running. My people have the perfect combination of brains and brawn.

Block: backstory
*%npc.name% smiles briefly and takes another sip*
!if npc.race=Ortolan! I actually replaced another Ortolan when I took this job. He was working here to put himself through the Music Academy back on Orto. Then he got a scholarship and left, which created the opening for me. We're actually good at this sort of work.
!ifnot npc.race=Ortolan! True, true. An Ortolan had been working this job before I took it. I suppose he couldn't handle it. My people are well-suited for this line of work.
Responses:
Oh, why is that? -> stacker2
Interesting. I guess you learn something every day. -> stackerredux
