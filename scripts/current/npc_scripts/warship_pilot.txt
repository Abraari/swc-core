I am currently doing nothing. I am waiting to get employed on a warship, and feel again the thrill of battle.
Responses:
It seems you enjoy being on the battlefield. -> battle
That is good, I hope you will find something soon. Farewell. -> Leavet

Block: battle
Of course! The battlefield has a unique atmosphere; it is like a giant game of two minds, and the one who is brave and cunning will always win there. But... %owner.name% does not give me much to do these days.

I may ask around if someone could employ you. Farewell. -> Leaveg
I must go now, good luck to you. -> Leavet
