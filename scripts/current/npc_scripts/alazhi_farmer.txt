At the moment I am checking the oxidation levels to ensure optimum production levels from the xoorzi. It's a bit technical but I could take a few hours to explain it to you ... I could use the break.

Why do I get the impression that you are wasting my time on purpose? -> gun
No thank you. I am more interested in where I could make a purchase. -> Purchase

Unfortunately we do not sell directly to the public. I believe our harvest is sold directly for the manufacture of bacta. Perhaps you could try the market?
