*The %npc.race% in front of you lounges against some cargo containers, and looks at you curiously*
Hi there. Looking for anyone in particular?
Responses:
Not really. Just taking a look around. -> look
!ifnot character.isowner! Yeah. I'm looking for %owner.name%. -> owner
!if character.isowner! Give me a status report. -> status
What are you up to at the moment? -> moment

Block: look
Really? Not much to look at around here. 
!if container.entityType in [City, Planet]! There is a nice breeze here don'tcha think? I like coming out here to think and enjoy my breaks.
!if container.entityType in [City, Planet]! !if time.ofday=Evening! Look at that sunset. Its glorious. Wish I could stay here forever and watch it.
!ifnot container.entityType in [City, Planet]! Pah, would you look at this place. Bulkheads, metal, and minimalist design everywhere. If only for some nice wall coverings and other paraphernalia to liven the place up.
Might want to return back where you came from really.
Responses:
!if container.entityType in [City, Planet]! !ifnot location.planet=Alderaan! Yeah it is nice here. Not a patch on the vistas on Alderaan though. -> alderaan
!if container.entityType in [City, Planet]! !if location.planet=Alderaan! Yeah. One of the nicer planets I think. -> nice
Yeah. Might do that actually. -> leave

Block: leave
Ok then, have fun. I won't expect to see you around again.

Block: owner
Ah, everyone seems to want them. I haven't seen them for a while actually, so you might find it easier to just contact them.
Here, I have their holoaddress that you can send to.
Responses:
Thanks. -> leave
Actually, didn't care that much. -> care
*Shrug* -> leave

Sure thing %character.formal%. 
There actually has been a small hiccup in the project, but with the help of the foreman, we've managed to get past it and we're back on track.
We should be completed on time, and in budget.
Responses:
Hiccup? How come I didn't head about this before? -> hiccup
Excellent. Carry on. -> start
Well, I suppose that is ok. I'll be off, so no slacking. -> leave2

Block: leave2
Sure thing boss. I'll see you again I suppose.

Block: care
Really? Then why ask? Bloody nusiance disturbing me in my break and asking pointless questions!
Go back to where you came from, and don't bother me again!

Block: hiccup
Oh, it was only a small thing. Barely disrupted us for an hour. Nothing to get worried about to be honest.

Block: moment
Me? Not much. In the middle of my break at the moment. Not much going on at the moment.
!if time.ofday=Morning! Really, I've only just come on shift a few hours ago. Got the rest of the day to work.
!if time.ofday=Afternoon! Shift is almost over. Another few hours, and then off to the sack. Or the tavern. Might need a few drinks after this.
!if time.ofday=Evening! Well, looking at the time, its basically time for me to go home.
Responses:
Ah ok then. I'll leave you to it then. -> leave
!if time.ofday=Evening! Want to head to the local tavern with me? -> tavern
Can you spare some credits? -> credits

Block: credits
Nah, sorry. Got just enough for me and my family to live off, and not much more than that.

Block: tavern
Might be an idea. Have to check with my boss first though.

Block: alderaan
Well, it sure is mighty pretty, but sometimes it gets boring. Sometimes a little imperfection magnifies the rest and makes it much more impressive.
But horses for courses as they say. I like my little patch.
Repsonses:
Yeah. -> leave
Hmm. Actually got a few more questions for you. -> start

Block: nice
Yeah. Some say that Alderaan is just too pretty, too perfect, but they are crazy. Too perfect? Are they listening to what they are saying?
Responses:
Anyway, I have a few other things to chat about. -> start

Block: like
Yeah, well some people should be shot, killed, and restored to life so they can be shot again. 
They just don't have any <i>style</i>. What about you?
Responses:
I quite like it actually. -> shot
Meh, not my style at all. -> style

Block: shot
That ... thats ... I ... oh to hell with it. I don't think I can talk with you anymore.

Block: style
Excatly. Oh well, at least one kindrid spirit around here anyway.
