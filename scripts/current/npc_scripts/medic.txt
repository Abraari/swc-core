Hello there, its a wonderful %time.ofday% wouldn't you say?
Is there something you want from me?
Responses:
Yeah, I'm wondering if you can heal me? -> heal
Just looking around, seeing what everyone does. -> look
I'm wondering what the best bacta tank is. -> tank

Block: heal
Ah, I'm afraid I've been getting that a lot recently. Without the right equipment, I cannot perform any operations, even minor cuts or scrapes. 
You'll have to take it up with the nearest medical establishment, see if they can help you there.
Responses:
Really? Oh well. I'll just bleed to death then. -> bleed
Ach. Pah in that case I'll look around. -> look

Block: look
Well you can look, just don't touch. Some of these tools are expensive, and even I am not allowed to touch them yet.
%npc.owner% wouldn't be too happy with you if you did.
Responses:
Sheesh does anyone do any work around here? -> work
Oh. Can't you use them to heal me? -> heal

Block: bleed
Looks like you might have to then. I'm afraid I really cannot do anything to help you as of the moment.
Tell you what, %npc.owner% might cut you a deal if you tell them I sent you. But don't pin your hopes on it.
Responses:
Pah, some medic you are. -> leave
Thanks, I'll try that. -> leave

Block: leave
Ok, see you later. Hopefully. That cut looks nasty.

Block: work
Of course they do. Its just that while people like you are sniffing around, asking innane questions, no-one can get any work done. Therefore we all look like slackers.
Responses:
Right. Sure. Well, I had better leave then hadn't I? -> leave
Ah, makes a lot of sense now you say that. -> leave
Well, since I'm disturbing you anyway, whats the best bacta tank? -> tank

Block: tank
The best? Well really they are all the same, at least for most uses. 
!if faction.type=Medical! I hear the ones that %faction.name% has are quite unique, but I'm not sure if they are selling them. Might to you though.
!ifnot faction.type=Medical! You may what to look around. I don't think your company can actually supply them.
Responses:
Thanks, that was useful. -> leave
That was completely useless. -> useless
Hmm, but they are so expensive! -> expensive

Block: expensive
Yeah, but if you want quality merchandise, you have to pay. Its your health after all.

Block: useless
Well, if thats what you think, sure why not. But some people have found it helps. 
Do your own research if you don't like what I have to say. In fact do it anyway.
