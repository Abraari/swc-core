The Floating Rock Gardens have been on Ryloth for thousands of years. They were caused by the erosion from the ancient water ways that passed through here. The planet's high force concentration caused the rocks to float.

If you'll look over here, you'll see the damage caused by the Ryloth civil war, which took place on this very ground. In fact, these Rock gardens have been part of Ryloth's history for more than 3,000 years. If you'd like more information, a pamphlet can be found in the building.
