Oh, hi there. Umm, did you want something?
Responses:
What are you doing? -> doing
!if location.city! What is this place? -> place
No, I'm just taking a look around. -> look

Block: doing
Me? Oh. I'm designing a brand new engine. See I'm working for %owner.name% designing this new ship. Its going to be a paradigm shift in space technologies.
At the moment I'm working on a new method of using the ion engines to create more thrust.
Responses:
New ships huh? -> new
I'll just take a look around. -> look

Block: look
!if npc.enemy! NO! You can't. Its not allowed. You must leave.
!if npc.enemy! *The %npc.race% waves his hands at you and pushes you out*
!if npc.neutral! NO! You can't. Its not allowed. You must leave.
!if npc.nuetral! *The %npc.race% waves his hands at you and pushes you out*
!if npc.ally! Oh. Ok. Have a look around then, and ask any questions if you see something interesting.
Responses:
!if npc.neutral! But, but ... oh. -> leave
!if npc.ally! Sure thing. See you around. -> leave
!if npc.ally! Hmm, what are you doing there? -> doing

Block: leave
Yes, yes, goodbye.

Block: place
This? Its %location.city% don'tcha know? Have a look around, maybe you'll go bother someone else who isn't working on a brand new engine design.
Responses:
Oh, ok then. -> leave
New engines? Really. -> doing

Block: engines
Well of course it is. It will generate enough power to double the speed of any ship in the galaxy in sublight.
See I used a reflux capacitor to return the overflow generation current back to the dampers, which causes an increase in power flow.
This allows more power to be achieved with the same fuel supply. Quite simple really.
Responses:
Wouldn't that cause a massive overload on the main coils? -> coil
!if npc.ally! Thats my man. Good work. -> leave

Block: new
Well yeah. Thats what our entire department is about. Did you get lost on the way to the coffee room perchance?
Responses:
Maybe. Yeah. -> leave
Nah. Whats up with those engines you were talking about? -> engines

Block: coil
That? Pah, use some ultracooled stock cells, link them up with the subspace manifold and you avoid all that. Are you trying to steal my work?
Responses:
No. Just interested. -> leave
Maybe. -> leave
