Why yes. Hello there. -> talk
Umm, I think you mean someone else. -> else

Block: talk
So, you have been talking with the prison guards. Whats their opinion on the escape? Anything out of the ordinary?
Responses:
Well, there are many varied hypotheses on the escape. -> escape
Actually, you have the wrong person. -> else
No comment -> else

Oh, leaving so soon? Must have an important meeting. And that was the interview with %character.name%. I am %npc.name% for %owner.name%.

Block: else
Are you sure? I have your name as our expert. Sorry people, but it seems we've had a bit of a technically difficulty. 
Please bear with us for just one moment.
Responses:
Oh, sorry, forgot where I was for a second there. Please continue. -> talk

Block: escape
Indeed. So what is you're opinion then, %character.name%? Is it a case of accidents, or bumbling officers?
Responses:
Well, not to tread on toes, but the security was pretty lax. -> lax
I find that nothing about this interests me. I must be going. -> leave
No comment -> else

Block: lax
Really? That's quite contrary to public announcements don't you think?
Responses:
Well obviously. They aren't going to make themselves look bad, are they? -> leave
Oh, you think? I don't read any news I'm afraid. -> leave

Block: anyone
That's what is being spread, but don't you think that they would say that anyway?
Responses:
Actually, now you come to say that, they would. -> leave
