Hi there, I'm %npc.name%. Welcome to my little home.
!if location.planet! This place, %location.planet% is my little home. Not much maybe for someone so grand, but it suits me fine.
!ifnot location.planet! I've not settled down yet. Still got some adventure left in me I think.

Hi, I'm %character.name%. What do you get up to? -> job
!if location.planet! This is a nice little planet. I may end up settling down here too. -> settle
!if location.planet! Pah, I wouldn't grant this little hunk of rock the name planet. -> hate
!ifnot location.planet! Where do you think you may end up? -> end

Block: job
Not much. A little bit of this, a little of that. Do the odd jobs that usually turn up everywhere.
Responses:
Interesting. You've made yourself a nice place. -> place
Ah. One of them. -> one
Thanks. I'd better be going. -> leave

Block: leave
Sure. See you around then. Nice talking to you.

Block: settle
Yeah. I like the weather we get here, some really nice sunsets and all that. Makes you really glad to be alive some days.
What about you, what do you like about this place?
Responses:
Actually, I don't really like it here. -> hate
Yeah the sunsets are nice. I like the wildlife. -> creatures

Block: creatures
Yeah. A bit fierce for my liking some of them, but some are quite fantastic. 
Anyway, I had better go - catch you later.
Responses:
Sure thing. -> leave

Block: one
What do you mean? I make my way as best as I can. Can't all be flying on super secret missions all over the galaxy.
Responses:
Hmm. Well I had better continue on my mission then. -> leave

Block: place
Why thank you. It's not great, but its the best around. And its home, like nothing else is.
Responses:
I can see that. Oh well, better be off then. -> leave
!if location.planet! This is a nice little planet. I may end up settling down here too. -> settle
!if location.planet! Pah, I wouldn't grant this little hunk of rock the name planet. -> hate
!ifnot location.planet! Where do you think you may end up? -> end

Block: know
Isn't it obvious? Fancy clothes, a personal spaceship, and a swagger that is detectable even by a blind man.
Responses:
Oh. Better leave you alone then huh? -> leave

Block: hate
Oh? Well I suppose %location.planet% is not for everyone. More for me I suppose.
I suppose you will be leaving now to get away? If you hate it that much that is.
Responses:
Ha, sorry. Was lying there. Quite like this place. -> settle

Block: end
To be honest, no idea at the moment. I wander from place to place, and when I find something that is interesting, I'll settle down for a bit. 
May get the urge to wander again later, but wouldn't be for a while I would guess.
Responses:
Ah, well good luck. -> leave
